# ðŸŒŸ AI-powered quiz app

Picture this: Youâ€™ve just been recruited into âœ¨*The Hottest AI Startupâ„¢*âœ¨. The mission? **Revolutionize quizzes forever.**

The hype in the office is contagious and everyone is looking forward to the release in a few days.

But hereâ€™s the catch:

1. The **AI model isnâ€™t finished** yet. Something about training data being expensive?
2. **The intern leaked our API key**, and now we canâ€™t afford snacks, let alone an actual ML deployment.

So, here we are: No AI model, no budget, and the team unanimously decides that *you* can rise to the challenge. Your
mission, amongst other things is to **build a temporary testing GUI**. The GUI will:

1. [x] Make use of the current best Model (`Mimic`â„¢ ðŸŽ­) we have come up with.
2. [x] Display the questions in a way that convinces the team itâ€™ll all work out.
3. [x] Stop people from crying into their keyboards.

Oh, and youâ€™re *allowed* to use your own API key for testing... but only if youâ€™re feeling generous. You know, because
youâ€™re a team player and stuff. No pressure or anything.

The team has provided you with a few more documents to help you with your new task. Be sure to check out the task
details, and if you need a bit more help, the hints are always available for you.
